# Software-Engineering-2

This repository is dedicated to publish the created code during the software engineering 2 lecture in summer term 2018.

## Data
The used data are from [Open Date Portal of Deutsche Bahn](http://data.deutschebahn.com/dataset/data-call-a-bike). The downloaded and extracted files has to be put and extracted into the 'Opendata Bahn' folder. The size is to big for uploading them to this Repository.

## Data loading
If you want to start the presented code you have to extract the data in a needed format and data structer. You can do this by running dataStation.py or do an own file with this codes:

```python
> import data
> import pandas as pd

> # Load all files from csv and save them into a pickle. If a pickle is already existing
> # use this function instead: data.loadPickle()
> bookings = data.loadFilter(cityFilter='Frankfurt am Main')
> stations = data.loadStation()

> # Delet NaN-Values
> bookings = bookings.dropna()

> # This method call finally creates our needed framework and data files for further working.
> dataMatrix = data.createMatrix(bookings, stations)

```

Important: You need to have the folder 'Opendata Bahn' within your directory or change the path in the corresponding function calls.
